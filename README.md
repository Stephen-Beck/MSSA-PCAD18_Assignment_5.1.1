Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Do NOT convert to another data type, keep it as a number!

### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
```
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

---
### Example 2:
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
```
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
